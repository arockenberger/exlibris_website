 <head>It's Alive!, Albert Jærn, and Exhibitions</head>
 <p>Simple website is live</p>
 <p>Research on Albert Jærn: died in 1949, that means his works are public domain and can be re-published</p>
 <p>exhibition on Albert Jærn in 2019 with printing blocks from the book "Og så kom befrierne" (1945) and some exlibris. In Oslo, gallery 222T. I identified two reviews of the exhibition, one in Kunstkritikk.no and the other in Klassekampen (behind a paywall). Can Albert Jærn's Nachlass (parts of) be found in <a href="https://www.guttormsgaardsarkiv.no/">Guttormgaards Arkiv</a>? </p>

 <head>Albert Jærn, Digitisation and a Mysterious Exlibris Find</head>
 <p>I scanned the 1978 list of works of <persName ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/227262990">Albert Jærn</persName> (20 EXLIBRIS af tegneren, maleren og grafikeren ALBERT JÆRN. Ed. by Thor Bjørn Schyberg. Exlibristen: Frederikshavn 1978). The exlibris œuvre, collected and with a short biographical introduction by <persName ref="https://viaf.org/en/viaf/13434186">Thor Bjørn Schyberg</persName> was published with <orgName type= "publisher" ref="https://explore.gnd.network/gnd/404969-X">Exlibristen</orgName> THE publisher for German and Northern European exlibris literature in the <date from="1950" to="1999">2nd half of the 20th century</date>. It's a short booklet listing 477 exlibris by <persName ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/227262990">Albert Jærn</persName> for mainly Norwegian owners. It's not out of copyright since Schyberg only died in <date when="1992">1992</date>. I suppose I could ask <persName ref="https://viaf.org/viaf/34978072">Klaus Rödel</persName>, who owns Exlibristen publishing house, for reprint rights. No hurry, though. The booklet was published in a limited edition of 150 copies, of which I have number 109. It's part of the exlibris collection of <persName ref="https://www.digitalarkivet.no/pv00000003990587">Rolf Nysted Heier</persName> (<date from="1901" to="1992">1901-1992</date>) which I purchased from his eldest son in <date when="2024">2024</date>. The booklet has a handwritten dedication by Schyberg to Heier, which reads <quote>"Til Rolf Nysted Heier Th. Schyberg"</quote>. I assume this means this copy of the booklet was a gift from Schyberg to his former colleague and life-long exlibris friend Heier.</p>
  <p>Why did I scan the booklet? Firstly, bc. I will eventually digitise the entire Nysted Heier collection and my addenda to it. Once my research project is complete and I am ready to part with the collection, it will be donated to the University Library of Oslo and added to their catalogue for special collections. The other reason is that I create a database of Norwegian exlibris, which combines (1) a description of each exlibris according to the FISAE criteria, (2) a classification of the image contents, i.e. its iconography, using the ICONCLASS ontology, and (3) an image search/recognition algorithm for identification of exlibris where other information is lacking or insufficient. Call it a research tool for provenance – and exlibris collectors. There are 20 original exlibris by Albert Jærn in the booklet, showcasing a variety of styles he used in creating the many bookplates during his relatively short life.</p>
  <p>The main reason, though, is that I think I have found a hitherto unknown Albert Jærn exlibris. A friend of mine gave me a book a couple of weeks ago which they wanted to part with. It has an exlibris glued in, a rather small one, but with a two-colour print (blue and black ink). It is likely a cliché - or could it be a relief print? I have not been able to identify it in any of Albert Jærn's lists of works; however, it bears his signature: ♂. I will conduct further research on the owner, O. Sandaa, and I believe I am on the right track. Once I have a solid lead, I'll post about it.</p>
  <p>What else can I add? I suppose that Albert Jærn must be, if not the most prolific, at least one of the most productive exlibris creators in Norway. During his rather short life, he created a large amount of exlibris - while his daily bread was working as an illustrator for several Norwegian publishing houses (Aschehoug being one of them) and advertisement companies. His illustrations were primarily drawings (ink), but he also seemed to have enjoyed using woodcuts and linocuts as a medium of artistic expression. Most notable perhaps is his "diary", published shortly after the end of the Nazi-German occupation of Norway in the spring of 1945. The book, called "Og så kom befrierne" (And so arrived the liberators), combines short diary-style notes and expressive woodcuts with which Jærn tells his personal story of the years of war and occupation. It is not a rarity; you can still find the book in several antiquarian bookshops in Northern Europe, even though it was printed in a limited run. There exists a bibliophile edition (the actual first edition), which I do not have, but it appears to be in the collection of the Guttormsgaards Archive, as they recently used it in an art exhibition event. I have a copy in near-mint condition, which I recently found on Norway's version of eBay, finn.no. It will get digitised eventually, too.</p>

 <head>Handling Collections with Tropy, a Tool for the Exlibris Enthusiast?</head>
 <p>I'm a collector, but first and foremost, I am a researcher. So I use a lot of research tools for the exlibris collections I have and build. There's a neat digital tool, <a href="https://tropy.org/">Tropy</a>, developed for working with large (digital) photo collections, but it works equally well with almost any other kind of digital image.</p>
  <p>I've started adding the Nysted Heier collection (box "S" - owner names starting with the letter "S") and have taken inventory of the published exlibris in the special collection of the Bergen Public Library (take a look at it on their website – in Norwegian - <a href="https://bergenbibliotek.no/lokalhistorie/upubliserte-bergenstrykk/bergenske-ex-libris">Bergenske Ex libris</a> with ca. 1.000 exlibris that have the city of Bergen as their motif or are in some other way connected to Bergen.</p>
  <p>A few years back, the Bergen Public Library had acquired the <a href="https://bergenbibliotek.no/spesialsamlinger/okland/ekslibris">collection</a> of poet and collector Einar Økland <a href="https://viaf.org/viaf/93369067">(entry in VIAF)</a> which contains some 100+ Norwegian exlibris.</p>
  <p>The main collection at the Bergen Public Library was initiated in the 1940s by Hanna Wiig (1885–1959) <a href="https://viaf.org/viaf/17204788">(entry in VIAF)</a> She was in charge of the children's library then. With a call to the public in the magazine "Krebsen" (The Crab) from 1941, she asks the public to donate a pair of each Exlibris they have to the library's growing collection: <span lang="nb">"Jeg må derfor få nytte høve til å be om at ex libriseiere som leser dette vil sende 2 eksemplarer av sitt ex libris inn til Bergens offentlige biblioteks Billedavdeling. Alle bidrag vil bli mottatt med den største takknemlighet."</span> (p. 61)</p>
  <p>So, how to use Tropy? Tropy is a simple database that runs locally on your computer. It is open-source software and doesn't cost you any money to download and use. You start by adding a digital image of an exlibris to it and create a "collection", which can be anything from "your collection" of all exlibris to a thematic or one by the artist. Under "Metadata", you add information about the individual piece, like artist, owner, technique, year of creation, etc., you name it! It then lets you search and sort your collection. Of course, if your collection doesn't contain many pieces, using a digital tool might be too much; however, once your collection reaches a certain number of exlibris, I think it comes in handy.</p>
  <p>In other news: A wood engraving exlibris for Werner Grebe by Belgian artist Frank-Ivo van Damme <a href="https://viaf.org/viaf/280985579">(entry in VIAF)</a> has arrived, thanks to Andreas Raub (D.E.G. The German Exlibris Society). For my personal collection, I primarily collect relief printing, especially woodcuts and linocuts; I am delighted to add this beautiful piece to my collection.</p>

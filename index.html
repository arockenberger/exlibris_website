<h2>2025-08-11 - Another Norwegian Mystery Exlibris?</h2>  
<p>On Friday, a book came into my possion: "Kvindehaderne" by Vicente Blasco Ibanez, translated by Dannis Sandberg and published in 1924 in Kristiania (Oslo). The book itself is of no interest to me, what intrigued me though was the exlibris glued into the case/endpaper of the hard cover. It is a simple woodcut print, black and white, in the top part "Ex Libris", in the bottom the name of the owner, "Joh. Wold". It depicts a felled pine tree and two exposed tree stubs, possibly alluding to the owner's profession. There is an artist signature in the bottom left corner, reading HK. The other side of the endpaper bears the handwritten name Johan Wold and the year 1931.</p>
<p>We may assume that the owner is a Johan Wold, that the book entered his possession in 1931 and that he outfitted it with an exlibris. Since the book is a Norwegian translation and I found it in Norway, I assume that the owner is a Norwegian, too. However, a quick check in the Norwegian exlibris catalogue reveals no exlibris with an owner named "Johan Wold". And the booklet with artists signatures has no entry for "HK" either"! This could mean several things. (1) Johan Wold is not a Norwegian. He could be a Dane or a Swede, who lived temporarily in Norway or whose Norwegian book ended up in Norway. The latter is unlikely. (2) The exlibris is created before the Norwegian exlbiris boom in the 1940s and outside of Oslo (and Bergen) and thus never got noticed by the Exlibris Circle in Oslo and Thorbjørn Schyberg.</p>
<p>To get some more information on "Johan Wold", we can look the name up in the Historical Population Register, HistReg.no. There are way too many persons with the same name and similar birth and death dates, to make a quick decision. Some hints lead to that our "Johan Wold" could be the same Johan Wold (1976-1956) whose obituary was published in the newspaper 1957 [newspaper article](https://www.schyberg.net/mslekt/johan80.html). More research has to be done to solve this puzzle!</p>


  <h2>2025-07-15 - Handling Collections with Tropy, a Tool for the Exlibris Enthusiast?</h2>
  <p>I'm a collector, but first and foremost, I am a researcher. So I use a lot of research tools for the exlibris collections I have and build. There's a neat digital tool, <a href="https://tropy.org/">Tropy</a>, developed for working with large (digital) photo collections, but it works equally well with almost any other kind of digital image.</p>
  <p>I've started adding the Nysted Heier collection (box "S" - owner names starting with the letter "S") and have taken inventory of the published exlibris in the special collection of the Bergen Public Library (take a look at it on their website – in Norwegian - <a href="https://bergenbibliotek.no/lokalhistorie/upubliserte-bergenstrykk/bergenske-ex-libris">Bergenske Ex libris</a> with ca. 1.000 exlibris that have the city of Bergen as their motif or are in some other way connected to Bergen.</p>
  <p>A few years back, the Bergen Public Library had acquired the <a href="https://bergenbibliotek.no/spesialsamlinger/okland/ekslibris">collection</a> of poet and collector Einar Økland <a href="https://viaf.org/viaf/93369067">(entry in VIAF)</a> which contains some 100+ Norwegian exlibris.</p>
  <p>The main collection at the Bergen Public Library was initiated in the 1940s by Hanna Wiig (1885–1959) <a href="https://viaf.org/viaf/17204788">(entry in VIAF)</a> She was in charge of the children's library then. With a call to the public in the magazine "Krebsen" (The Crab) from 1941, she asks the public to donate a pair of each Exlibris they have to the library's growing collection: <span lang="nb">"Jeg må derfor få nytte høve til å be om at ex libriseiere som leser dette vil sende 2 eksemplarer av sitt ex libris inn til Bergens offentlige biblioteks Billedavdeling. Alle bidrag vil bli mottatt med den største takknemlighet."</span> (p. 61)</p>
  <p>So, how to use Tropy? Tropy is a simple database that runs locally on your computer. It is open-source software and doesn't cost you any money to download and use. You start by adding a digital image of an exlibris to it and create a "collection", which can be anything from "your collection" of all exlibris to a thematic or one by the artist. Under "Metadata", you add information about the individual piece, like artist, owner, technique, year of creation, etc., you name it! It then lets you search and sort your collection. Of course, if your collection doesn't contain many pieces, using a digital tool might be too much; however, once your collection reaches a certain number of exlibris, I think it comes in handy.</p>
  <p>In other news: A wood engraving exlibris for Werner Grebe by Belgian artist Frank-Ivo van Damme <a href="https://viaf.org/viaf/280985579">(entry in VIAF)</a> has arrived, thanks to Andreas Raub (D.E.G. The German Exlibris Society). For my personal collection, I primarily collect relief printing, especially woodcuts and linocuts; I am delighted to add this beautiful piece to my collection.</p>
  
  
  <h2>2025-06-30 - Albert Jærn, Digitisation and a Mysterious Exlibris Find</h2>
  <p>I scanned the 1978 list of works of Albert Jærn <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/227262990">(entry in VIAF)</a> (20 EXLIBRIS af tegneren, maleren og grafikeren ALBERT JÆRN. Ed. by Thor Bjørn Schyberg. Exlibristen: Frederiks<s>tad</s>havn 1978). The exlibris œvre, collected and with a short biographical introduction by Thor Bjørn Schyberg <a href="https://viaf.org/en/viaf/13434186">(entry in VIAF)</a> was published with Exlibristen<a href="https://explore.gnd.network/gnd/404969-X">(entry in GND)</a> THE publisher for German and Northern European exlibris literature in the 2nd half of the 20th century. It's a short booklet listing 477 exlibris by Albert Jærn for mainly Norwegian owners. It's not out of copyright since Schyberg only died in 1992. I suppose I could ask Klaus Rödel, who owns Exlibristen publishing house, for reprint rights. No hurry, though. The booklet was published in a limited edition of 150 copies, of which I have number 109. It's part of the exlibris collection by Rolf Nysted Heier (1901-1992) <a href="//www.digitalarkivet.no/pv00000003990587">(entry in HistReg)</a> which I purchased from his eldest son in 2024. The booklet has a handwritten dedication by Schyberg to Heier, which reads "Til Rolf Nysted Heier Th. Schyberg". I assume this means this copy of the booklet was a gift from Schyberg to his former colleague and life-long exlibris friend Heier.</p>
  <p>Why did I scan the booklet? Firstly, bc. I will eventually digitise the entire Nysted Heier collection and my addenda to it. Once my research project is complete and I am ready to part with the collection, it will be donated to the University Library of Oslo and added to their catalogue for special collections. The other reason is that I create a database of Norwegian exlibris, which combines (1) a description of each exlibris according to the FISAE criteria, (2) a classification of the image contents, i.e. its iconography, using the ICONCLASS ontology, and (3) an image search/recognition algorithm for identification of exlibris where other information is lacking or insufficient. Call it a research tool for provenance – and exlibris collectors. There are 20 original exlibris by Albert Jærn in the booklet, showcasing a variety of styles he used in creating the many bookplates during his relatively short life.</p>
  <p>The main reason, though, is that I think I have found a hitherto unknown Albert Jærn exlibris. A friend of mine gave me a book a couple of weeks ago which they wanted to part with. It has an exlibris glued in, a rather small one, but with a two-colour print (blue and black ink). It is likely a cliché - or could it be a relief print? I have not been able to identify it in any of Albert Jærn's lists of works; however, it bears his signature: ♂. I will conduct further research on the owner, O. Sandaa, and I believe I am on the right track. Once I have a solid lead, I'll post about it.</p>
  <p>What else can I add? I suppose that Albert Jærn must be, if not the most prolific, at least one of the most productive exlibris creators in Norway. During his rather short life, he created a large amount of exlibris - while his daily bread was working as an illustrator for several Norwegian publishing houses (Aschehoug being one of them) and advertisement companies. His illustrations were primarily drawings (ink), but he also seemed to have enjoyed using woodcuts and linocuts as a medium of artistic expression. Most notable perhaps is his "diary", published shortly after the end of the Nazi-German occupation of Norway in the spring of 1945. The book, called "Og så kom befrierne" (And so arrived the liberators), combines short diary-style notes and expressive woodcuts with which Jærn tells his personal story of the years of war and occupation. It is not a rarity; you can still find the book in several antiquarian bookshops in Northern Europe, even though it was printed in a limited run. There exists a bibliophile edition (the actual first edition), which I do not have, but it appears to be in the collection of the Guttormsgaards Archive, as they recently used it in an art exhibition event. I have a copy in near-mint condition, which I recently found on Norway's version of eBay, finn.no. It will get digitised eventually, too.</p>

<h2>2025-08-11 - Another Norwegian Mystery Exlibris?</h2>  
<p>On Friday, a book came into my possession: "Kvindehaderne" ("The Enemies of Women", 1919) by Spanish writer Vicente Blasco Ibanez, translated by Dannis Sandberg and published in 1924 in Kristiania (Oslo). The book itself is of no interest to me; what intrigued me, though, was the exlibris glued into the case/endpaper of the hardcover. It is a simple woodcut print, black and white, featuring "Ex Libris" at the top and the name of the owner, "Joh. Wold", at the bottom. It depicts a felled pine tree and two exposed tree stubs, possibly alluding to the owner's profession – or, as a symbolic image, the death or loss of somebody. There is an artist's signature in the bottom left corner, reading HK. The other side of the endpaper bears the handwritten name Johan Wold and below the year 1931.</p>
<p>We may assume that the owner is a certain Johan Wold, that the book entered his possession in 1931 and that he outfitted it with an exlibris right there and then or somewhen later. Since the book is a Norwegian translation and I found it in the Åmot area in Norway among a pile of old books from the Public Library at Modum and the Blaafarveværket school library, I assume that the owner is a Norwegian, possibly from that region, too. However, a quick check in the Norwegian exlibris catalogue ("Norske exlibris: fortegnelse over 8650 norske exlibris", 1974) reveals no exlibris with an owner named "Johan Wold". And the booklet with artists' signatures ("Norske Ex Libris Signaturer", 1948) has no entry for "HK" either! So, we cannot easily identify the owner or the artist.</p>
<p>Why is the exlibris not catalogued? There are some possible explanations:</p>
<p>(1) Johan Wold is not a Norwegian. He could be a Dane or a Swede, who (a) lived temporarily in Norway or (b) whose Norwegian book ended up in the Norwegian countryside. The "W" in the last name "Wold" instead of the more common Norwegian "V", "Vold" (both have the same sound in Norwegian) could be an indicator that the person is of Swedish origin, since this version is much more common there. However, since writing conventions are not that strong and there are many family relations between Norwegians and Swedes, this is not a strong argument. That the book carrying the exlibris made it into Norway from either Denmark or Sweden is rather unlikely; it is a Norwegian translation of a foreign title, and with Norwegian being the smaller 'sibling' of the three Scandinavian countries with a much smaller literary market, a Dane or Swede living outside of Norway would probably purchase a Danish or Swedish translation instead of a Norwegian one.</p>
<p>(2) The exlibris is created before the Norwegian exlibris boom in the 1940s and outside of Oslo (and Bergen) and thus never got noticed by the Oslo Exlibris Circle and Thorbjørn Schyberg, the author of the Norwegian exlibris catalogue. We have an indication of the date for the exlibris, albeit making quite a few assumptions. We can take the handwritten name and date, 1931, to indicate the acquisition of the book, and it would be natural to put an exlibris into a book when it enters a personal collection or library. Obviously, this is not a strong argument, as the exlibris could have been put there any time after the owner obtained the book. He could have added the handwritten note at a later point in time. But it is likely, for me, that 1931 is 'about the time' the exlibris was in use, and I argue that it was likely created and used around that time. Especially given that Schyberg did not register it in the catalogue.</p>
<p> It would help us in our quest to identify the exlibris if we knew who the artist "HK" was. The booklet with artists' signatures is by no means complete, but it covers quite a few Norwegian exlibris artists. Since it leaves us without a clue, I need to consult some older exlibris literature to find out more about the artist.</p>
<p>To get some more information on the owner, "Johan Wold", we can look the name up in the Norwegian Historical Population Register, [HistReg.no](https://histreg.no/index.php/home). A search reveals that there are way too many individuals with the same name and similar birth and death dates, making it difficult to make a quick decision. When doing a Google search with the combinations of "Johan Wold" + "skog" (forest), or "skogsbruk" (forestry) or the region I found the book in (Åmot, Modum, in Buskerud fylke), a few ancestry pages pop up giving us some potential hints. It could be that our "Johan Wold" is the same Johan Wold (1876-1956) whose obituary was published in a newspaper in 1957 [newspaper article](https://www.schyberg.net/mslekt/johan80.html). This Johan Wold experienced a family tragedy in his early life, losing his younger brother at sea, which the symbolism of the exlibris motif could refer to. Another hint suggests a doctor with the same name, possibly in the region, but with even less information and no relation to the exlibris motif. Both sources are weak; neither gives a clear connection to the motif depicted in the exlibris or to a person who was a book collector or interested in bookplates or small-scale graphical art. I have to do more research to solve this puzzle!</p>
<p>For the time being, the exlibris "Joh. Wold" is yet another uncatalogued Norwegian exlibris of the first half of the 20th century.</p>


  <h2>2025-07-15 - Handling Collections with Tropy, a Tool for the Exlibris Enthusiast?</h2>
  <p>I'm a collector, but first and foremost, I am a researcher. So I use a lot of research tools for the exlibris collections I have and build. There's a neat digital tool, <a href="https://tropy.org/">Tropy</a>, developed for working with large (digital) photo collections, but it works equally well with almost any other kind of digital image.</p>
  <p>I've started adding the Nysted Heier collection (box "S" - owner names starting with the letter "S") and have taken inventory of the published exlibris in the special collection of the Bergen Public Library (take a look at it on their website – in Norwegian - <a href="https://bergenbibliotek.no/lokalhistorie/upubliserte-bergenstrykk/bergenske-ex-libris">Bergenske Ex libris</a> with ca. 1.000 exlibris that have the city of Bergen as their motif or are in some other way connected to Bergen.</p>
  <p>A few years back, the Bergen Public Library had acquired the <a href="https://bergenbibliotek.no/spesialsamlinger/okland/ekslibris">collection</a> of poet and collector Einar Økland <a href="https://viaf.org/viaf/93369067">(entry in VIAF)</a> which contains some 100+ Norwegian exlibris.</p>
  <p>The main collection at the Bergen Public Library was initiated in the 1940s by Hanna Wiig (1885–1959) <a href="https://viaf.org/viaf/17204788">(entry in VIAF)</a> She was in charge of the children's library then. With a call to the public in the magazine "Krebsen" (The Crab) from 1941, she asks the public to donate a pair of each Exlibris they have to the library's growing collection: <span lang="nb">"Jeg må derfor få nytte høve til å be om at ex libriseiere som leser dette vil sende 2 eksemplarer av sitt ex libris inn til Bergens offentlige biblioteks Billedavdeling. Alle bidrag vil bli mottatt med den største takknemlighet."</span> (p. 61)</p>
  <p>So, how to use Tropy? Tropy is a simple database that runs locally on your computer. It is open-source software and doesn't cost you any money to download and use. You start by adding a digital image of an exlibris to it and create a "collection", which can be anything from "your collection" of all exlibris to a thematic or one by the artist. Under "Metadata", you add information about the individual piece, like artist, owner, technique, year of creation, etc., you name it! It then lets you search and sort your collection. Of course, if your collection doesn't contain many pieces, using a digital tool might be too much; however, once your collection reaches a certain number of exlibris, I think it comes in handy.</p>
  <p>In other news: A wood engraving exlibris for Werner Grebe by Belgian artist Frank-Ivo van Damme <a href="https://viaf.org/viaf/280985579">(entry in VIAF)</a> has arrived, thanks to Andreas Raub (D.E.G. The German Exlibris Society). For my personal collection, I primarily collect relief printing, especially woodcuts and linocuts; I am delighted to add this beautiful piece to my collection.</p>
  
  
  <h2>2025-06-30 - Albert Jærn, Digitisation and a Mysterious Exlibris Find</h2>
  <p>I scanned the 1978 list of works of Albert Jærn <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/227262990">(entry in VIAF)</a> (20 EXLIBRIS af tegneren, maleren og grafikeren ALBERT JÆRN. Ed. by Thor Bjørn Schyberg. Exlibristen: Frederiks<s>tad</s>havn 1978). The exlibris œvre, collected and with a short biographical introduction by Thor Bjørn Schyberg <a href="https://viaf.org/en/viaf/13434186">(entry in VIAF)</a> was published with Exlibristen<a href="https://explore.gnd.network/gnd/404969-X">(entry in GND)</a> THE publisher for German and Northern European exlibris literature in the 2nd half of the 20th century. It's a short booklet listing 477 exlibris by Albert Jærn for mainly Norwegian owners. It's not out of copyright since Schyberg only died in 1992. I suppose I could ask Klaus Rödel, who owns Exlibristen publishing house, for reprint rights. No hurry, though. The booklet was published in a limited edition of 150 copies, of which I have number 109. It's part of the exlibris collection by Rolf Nysted Heier (1901-1992) <a href="//www.digitalarkivet.no/pv00000003990587">(entry in HistReg)</a> which I purchased from his eldest son in 2024. The booklet has a handwritten dedication by Schyberg to Heier, which reads "Til Rolf Nysted Heier Th. Schyberg". I assume this means this copy of the booklet was a gift from Schyberg to his former colleague and life-long exlibris friend Heier.</p>
  <p>Why did I scan the booklet? Firstly, bc. I will eventually digitise the entire Nysted Heier collection and my addenda to it. Once my research project is complete and I am ready to part with the collection, it will be donated to the University Library of Oslo and added to their catalogue for special collections. The other reason is that I create a database of Norwegian exlibris, which combines (1) a description of each exlibris according to the FISAE criteria, (2) a classification of the image contents, i.e. its iconography, using the ICONCLASS ontology, and (3) an image search/recognition algorithm for identification of exlibris where other information is lacking or insufficient. Call it a research tool for provenance – and exlibris collectors. There are 20 original exlibris by Albert Jærn in the booklet, showcasing a variety of styles he used in creating the many bookplates during his relatively short life.</p>
  <p>The main reason, though, is that I think I have found a hitherto unknown Albert Jærn exlibris. A friend of mine gave me a book a couple of weeks ago which they wanted to part with. It has an exlibris glued in, a rather small one, but with a two-colour print (blue and black ink). It is likely a cliché - or could it be a relief print? I have not been able to identify it in any of Albert Jærn's lists of works; however, it bears his signature: ♂. I will conduct further research on the owner, O. Sandaa, and I believe I am on the right track. Once I have a solid lead, I'll post about it.</p>
  <p>What else can I add? I suppose that Albert Jærn must be, if not the most prolific, at least one of the most productive exlibris creators in Norway. During his rather short life, he created a large amount of exlibris - while his daily bread was working as an illustrator for several Norwegian publishing houses (Aschehoug being one of them) and advertisement companies. His illustrations were primarily drawings (ink), but he also seemed to have enjoyed using woodcuts and linocuts as a medium of artistic expression. Most notable perhaps is his "diary", published shortly after the end of the Nazi-German occupation of Norway in the spring of 1945. The book, called "Og så kom befrierne" (And so arrived the liberators), combines short diary-style notes and expressive woodcuts with which Jærn tells his personal story of the years of war and occupation. It is not a rarity; you can still find the book in several antiquarian bookshops in Northern Europe, even though it was printed in a limited run. There exists a bibliophile edition (the actual first edition), which I do not have, but it appears to be in the collection of the Guttormsgaards Archive, as they recently used it in an art exhibition event. I have a copy in near-mint condition, which I recently found on Norway's version of eBay, finn.no. It will get digitised eventually, too.</p>
